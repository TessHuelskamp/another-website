</p>

You can write in markdown and _underscore_ things and it'll work.

# You can make headers as you think they would work
[and also links](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)! wow!

* bulleted
* lists
* also
* work

Let's see how this looks
```
stuff = ["hello", "world"]
for word in stuff: print(word)
```
